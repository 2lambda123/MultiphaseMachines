Phase 1.2 IO Placement/ Clock Placement/ Build Placer Device
ERROR: [Place 30-575] Sub-optimal placement for a clock-capable IO pin and MMCM pair. If this sub optimal condition is acceptable for this design, you may use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint in the .xdc file to demote this message to a WARNING. However, the use of this override is highly discouraged. These examples can be used directly in the .xdc file to override this clock rule.
	< set_property CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE BACKBONE [get_nets design_1_i/fpga_dig_top_2/U0/data_clock_ctrl1/dco_buf] >

	design_1_i/fpga_dig_top_2/U0/data_clock_ctrl1/bufds (IBUFDS.O) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on IOB_X0Y24

	The above error could possibly be related to other connected instances. Following is a list of 
	all the related clock rules and their respective instances.

	Clock Rule: rule_mmcm_bufg
	Status: PASS 
	Rule Description: An MMCM driving a BUFG must be placed on the same half side (top/bottom) of the device
	design_1_i/fpga_dig_top_2/U0/data_clock_ctrl1/mmcm_top/mmcm_inst (MMCME2_ADV.CLKFBOUT) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on MMCME2_ADV_X0Y1
	design_1_i/fpga_dig_top_2/U0/data_clock_ctrl1/mmcm_top/BUFG_CLKFB (BUFG.I) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on BUFGCTRL_X0Y4

Resolution: A dedicated routing path between the two can be used if: (a) The clock-capable IO (CCIO) is placed on a CCIO capable site (b) The MMCM is placed in the same clock region as the CCIO pin. If the IOB is driving multiple MMCMs, all MMCMs must be placed in the same clock region, one clock region above or one clock region below the IOB. Both the above conditions must be met at the same time, else it may lead to longer and less predictable clock insertion delays.
