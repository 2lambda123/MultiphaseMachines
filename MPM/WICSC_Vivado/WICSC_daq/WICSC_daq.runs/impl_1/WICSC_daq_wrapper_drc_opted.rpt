AVAL-50#1 Error
MMCM_adv_ClkinPeriod_clkin1_3  
Unexpected MMCME2_ADV programming. For MMCME2_ADV cell WICSC_daq_i/AD9249_DAQ_custom_0/inst/data_clock_ctrl1/mmcm_top/mmcm_inst, the programming of CLKIN1_PERIOD for the reference clock frequency is expected to be greater than 0. When 0 is specified the device will not check that the VCO is operating within the allowed range.
Related violations: <none>

AVAL-50#2 Error
MMCM_adv_ClkinPeriod_clkin1_3  
Unexpected MMCME2_ADV programming. For MMCME2_ADV cell WICSC_daq_i/AD9249_DAQ_custom_0/inst/data_clock_ctrl2/mmcm_top/mmcm_inst, the programming of CLKIN1_PERIOD for the reference clock frequency is expected to be greater than 0. When 0 is specified the device will not check that the VCO is operating within the allowed range.

UTLZ-1#1 Error
Resource utilization  - PBlock:ROOT
MMCME2_ADV over-utilized in Top Level Design (This design requires more MMCME2_ADV cells than are available in the target device. This design requires 7 of such cell types but only 4 compatible sites are available in the target device. Please analyze your synthesis results and constraints to ensure the design is mapped to Xilinx primitives as expected. If so, please consider targeting a larger device.)ROOT

NSTD-1#1 Critical Warning
Unspecified I/O Standard  
38 out of 299 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'DEFAULT', instead of a user assigned specific value. This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined. To allow bitstream creation with unspecified I/O standard values (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks NSTD-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run. Problem ports: sysclk_ready_2, sysclk_ready_1, modulator_out[35:0].
Related violations: <none>

UCIO-1#1 Critical Warning
Unconstrained Logical Port  
118 out of 299 logical ports have no user assigned specific location constraint (LOC). This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all pin locations. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified site LOC constraint defined.  To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: sysclk_ready_2, sysclk_ready_1, lvds_fco2_p_2, lvds_fco2_p_1,
lvds_fco2_n_2, lvds_fco2_n_1, lvds_fco1_p_2, lvds_fco1_p_1,
lvds_data_a1_n_1, lvds_data_a1_n_2, lvds_data_a1_p_1, lvds_data_a1_p_2,
lvds_data_a2_n_1, lvds_data_a2_n_2, lvds_data_a2_p_1 (the first 15 of 83 listed).

PLCK-12#1 Warning
Clock Placer Checks  
Poor placement for routing between an IO pin and BUFG. 
Resolution: Poor placement of an IO pin and a BUFG has resulted in the router using a non-dedicated path between the two.  There are several things that could trigger this DRC, each of which can cause unpredictable clock insertion delays that result in poor timing.  This DRC could be caused by any of the following: (a) a clock port was placed on a pin that is not a CCIO-pin (b)the BUFG has not been placed in the same half of the device or SLR as the CCIO-pin (c) a single ended clock has been placed on the N-Side of a differential pair CCIO-pin.
 This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	WICSC_daq_i/AD9249_DAQ_custom_0/inst/iser_top1/IB1 (IBUFDS.O) is locked to N15
	WICSC_daq_i/AD9249_DAQ_custom_0/inst/iser_top1/BG1 (BUFG.I) cannot be placed
