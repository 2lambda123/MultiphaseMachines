## PCB Designs

### PCB Gerber and KiCad files for the Optical Transmitter board and the FMC connector board

#### The PCB are designed to use a 4 layer stackup with 0.12 mm controlled impedance material between top layer and inner layer one and between bottom layer and inner layer two.
#### The impedance matching was done with the intent of using Eurocircuits 4 layer controlled impedance stackup.
