## Enableboard PCB


### Function:
The purpose of the board is to generate the tweleve (12) optical "enable" signals for the IPM boards (WISCSC machine). 
Can be used standalone (using physical DIP switches) or be controlled using I2C protocol from an FPGA. The 3.3V line used
for the I2C communication can either be supplied externaly or internaly using a switch. 

### Information
